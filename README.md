# Case Study: Tastey Bytes - Recipe Site Track Analysis ðŸš§

### Background 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This situation-based project, involves applying data science techniques to solve a real-world problem: predicting recipts will drive more website traffic.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, recipe data is provied, and the business Tasty Bytes needs to understand what types of recipes attract high website traffic. The business also requested a perdiction model that help them figure out whether a particular recipe will drive up website traffic.    

**** per DataCamp's request: the project notebook is not shown since it is relevant to part of the exam. 
### Topics:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Processing, Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Visualization, Supervised Learning. 

### How I approached this Project:
- Data analysis : data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection. 
- EDA
- Data Visualization
- Model development: identity the the problem and pick 3 situable algorithms for this situation and performed grid search to find the algorithm meet business requriement. and evaluate it with new recipe.
 

### Note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due requriement from DataCamp, as this project is part of the exam. only the presentataion slide are shown here.
