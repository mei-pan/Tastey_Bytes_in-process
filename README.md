# Tastey Bytes - Recipe Site Track Analysis ðŸš§

### Background 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a scenario based case study as the last part of the DataCamp's Data Science Professional certifcation Exam. 
the case study compose of 2 parts: 1. end-to-end coding project and  2. a video presentataion. 
Scenario of the project: as a data scientist in a given company. the client (Tasty Bytes) a company provide various type of recipts to users. it wants to know what are the key indicators of recipets will drive up website traffic. it also request a machine learnig model that will predict if a new recipt will be popular. 
At the end, me as the project lead will give a verbal presentation on key findings 

**** per DataCamp's request: the project notebook is not shown since it is relevant to part of the exam. 
### Topics:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Processing, Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Visualization, Supervised Learning. 

### How I approached this Project:
- Exam and process the data deal with outlier, missing data etc and treat each according
- EDA
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning: identity the type of machine learning problem of this project, pick 3 algorithms that are suitable for this project through grid search, find the algorithm with the best performance. and evaluate it with new recipe.

- needed to write a report. 

### Note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due requriement from DataCamp, as this project is part of the exam. only the presentataion slide are shown here.
